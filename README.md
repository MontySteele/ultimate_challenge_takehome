# ultimate_challenge_takehome

### Take home challenge summary, part 1

In this part of the take-home challenge, I was given a json file, 'logins.json', containing login data for a group of users. I was asked to aggregate this user login data into 15-minute time intervals and perform exploratory data analysis to find trends in the login data.

My work is available in the file 'Ultimate_challenge_takehome_p1.ipynb'. I found that login counts are increasing over time in this dataset, increasing from January onward and seeming to peak in mid-March, although there is little data for February. 
Logins were lowest on Monday, gradually rising to a peak on Saturday and then dipping slightly on Sunday. On an hourly bases, logins follow a cyclical pattern of peaking around noon and midnight and being lowest in the morning and evening.
